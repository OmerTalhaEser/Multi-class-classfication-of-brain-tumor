# Multi-class-classfication-of-brain-tumor 
Our major aim is to create a system that can classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high precision. We make use of transfer learning techniques by employing pre-trained neural network models such as Xception, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121 as feature extractors for capturing meaningful information from the MRI images. And, we enhance their ability to differentiate between various tumor types by fine-tuning these models on our dataset so they can be more useful in diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings. Classification of these brain tumors was carried out by traditional machine-learning algorithms.

-- We have developed and proposed three distinct methods for the multi-class classification of brain tumors. 
-- 99.41% accuracy was gained by the proposed transfer learning-based k-fold method.
